# Prodigy InfoTech Internship — Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier
Welcome to my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship repository!  
This repository contains **Task 3**, which focuses on developing a machine learning model to analyze data and derive meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Task Overview
The objective of this task is to **build a Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on their **demographic and behavioral attributes**.  
This task uses the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, commonly used for predictive analytics and classification modeling.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me gain valuable experience in:
- Applying **data preprocessing and feature encoding**
- Splitting data into **training and test sets**
- Training a machine learning model using **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Evaluating performance using **accuracy score, classification report & confusion matrix**
- Understanding the **impact of feature importance** on model predictions
- Interpreting how customer attributes affect purchase decisions
